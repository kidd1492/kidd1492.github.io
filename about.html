                    <p>My name is Chris, and this is the chronicle of my self-taught journey into the realms of coding and electronics. 
                        Iâ€™ve always been driven by a curious nature. When Language Models (LMs) started gaining mainstream attention, 
                        it reignited my curiosity. In January of 2023, I embarked on my learning journey with Python. My first step 
                        was watching an MIT lecture on YouTube about the NLTK library and Python. After grasping the bare basics of 
                        Python and some fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP), I discovered the fascinating world of 
                        Data Analysis.</p><br/>

                        <p>I began taking MS Learn courses on Machine Learning, creating supervised machine learning models for regression 
                            analysis and categorical data. My journey then led me to Kaggle, where I delved deeper into data analysis and 
                            data cleaning. I found joy in learning about data, visualizing it to tell a story, and using it to predict 
                            future outcomes.</p><br/>
                            
                        <p>After several months of intense focus on code, I decided to take a break and dive into the world of electronics. 
                            I started learning about Arduino and ESP32 microcontrollers, and how electronics worked. Through understanding 
                            electronics and hardware, I gained a deeper comprehension of what a computer is and how it functions. 
                            I built several projects, including a pen plotter and an obstacle-avoiding robot. I also learned about 
                            HTTP servers and gained a better understanding of how the internet works.</p><br/>

                        <p>Then, I discovered the CS50x course on edX. It was one of the best resources Iâ€™ve found yet. I had been 
                            exploring various areas without a clear focus or a solid fundamental base for programming. 
                            CS50 introduced me to C programming and gave me an understanding of the abstractions in Python. 
                            I learned about Flask and Django, and the beginnings of web frameworks.</p><br/>

                        <p>This journey has been a blend of self-discovery, learning, and growth. As I continue to explore and learn, 
                            I look forward to what the future holds in this exciting world of technology.</p><br/>
