                    <p>Here you’ll find interactive Python notebooks, mathematical deep dives, and hands‑on 
                        explorations that trace machine learning from its historical roots to modern 
                        neural networks. The focus here isn’t just on using ML tools — it’s on understanding 
                        them from first principles. Whether you're studying linear regression, unpacking the 
                        geometry behind gradient descent, exploring the evolution of early perceptrons, or 
                        breaking down neural networks into their core mathematical components, this hub is 
                        built to make every concept transparent and intuitive.</p><br/>
                    <p> I invite you to learn alongside me. This hub grows as I grow — one concept, one experiment, 
                        and one breakthrough at a time.</p><br/>

                        <p>This repository is a hands-on exploration of agentic AI systems, with a focus on building 
                            and understanding agents from the ground up. The goal is to:</p>
                        <ul>Understand what an agent is and how it operates</ul>
                        <ul>Build a ReAct-style agents from scratch</ul>
                        <ul> progressing toward framework-based implementations</ul>
