                <p>Step into my digital workspace — a place built for exploration, experimentation, 
                    and continuous learning. This site brings together the tools, demos, and notes that 
                    shape my journey through programming, machine learning, and agentic systems.</p><br/>
                <h2>First‑Principles Focus</h2><br/>
                <p>Here you’ll find interactive Python notebooks, mathematical deep dives, and hands‑on 
                    explorations that trace machine learning from its historical roots to modern 
                    neural networks. The focus here isn’t just on using ML tools — it’s on understanding 
                    them from first principles. Whether you're studying linear regression, unpacking the 
                    geometry behind gradient descent, exploring the evolution of early perceptrons, or 
                    breaking down neural networks into their core mathematical components, this hub is 
                    built to make every concept transparent and intuitive.</p><br/>
                <p> I invite you to learn alongside me. This hub grows as I grow — one concept, one experiment, 
                    and one breakthrough at a time.</p><br/>

                <h2><a href="learning_hub.html">Explore the Learning Hub</a></h2>

                <p>The Learning Hub is where all of the hands‑on learning happens. 
                    It brings together clear notes, practical references, and interactive tools 
                    so you can build intuition step by step — from basic Python and JavaScript 
                    all the way to multi‑feature regression and neural networks.</p><br/>

                <p>Inside the Learning Hub you’ll find:</p><br/>
                <p>
                    • Python notes and reference material<br/>
                    • JavaScript notes and reference material<br/>
                    • A full sequence of neural network learning projects<br/>
                    • A single‑input linear regression tool you can experiment with<br/>
                    • A 3D multi‑feature regression simulator that visualizes planes, projections, and dot products</p><br/>
                <p>Each resource is designed to help you understand not just the formulas, 
                    but the geometry and intuition behind them. Whether you're adjusting weights 
                    in a regression model or exploring how neurons stack to solve nonlinear problems, 
                    the Learning Hub gives you a place to experiment, visualize, and learn by doing.</p>
