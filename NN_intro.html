                <p>Step into my digital workspace — a place built for exploration, experimentation, 
                    and continuous learning. This site brings together the tools, demos, and notes that 
                    shape my journey through programming, machine learning, and agentic systems.</p><br/>
                <h2>First‑Principles Focus</h2><br/>
                <p>Here you’ll find interactive Python notebooks, mathematical deep dives, and hands‑on 
                    explorations that trace machine learning from its historical roots to modern 
                    neural networks. The focus here isn’t just on using ML tools — it’s on understanding 
                    them from first principles. Whether you're studying linear regression, unpacking the 
                    geometry behind gradient descent, exploring the evolution of early perceptrons, or 
                    breaking down neural networks into their core mathematical components, this hub is 
                    built to make every concept transparent and intuitive.</p><br/>
                <p> I invite you to learn alongside me. This hub grows as I grow — one concept, one experiment, 
                    and one breakthrough at a time.</p><br/>
