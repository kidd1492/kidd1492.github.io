                <h2>Your Space to Learn by Building</h2>
                <br>

                <p>
                    The Learning Hub gives you a clear, hands-on path into programming, machine learning,
                    and neural networks. Instead of jumping between disconnected tutorials, everything here
                    is organized around first principles and practical exploration.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    You will find simple notes, clean references, and interactive tools that help you
                    understand how ideas work under the hood, whether you are writing your first Python
                    script, experimenting with JavaScript, or visualizing how a model learns from data.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>What You Will Find Here</h3>
                <br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Python notes and reference material</li>
                    <li>JavaScript notes and reference material</li>
                    <li>A full sequence of neural network learning projects</li>
                    <li>A single-input regression tool for experimenting with linear models</li>
                    <li>A 3D multi-feature regression simulator that shows planes, projections, and dot products</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <p>
                    Everything here is built to help you develop intuition, not just code. You will see how
                    data transforms through models, how simple mathematical pieces combine into powerful
                    systems, and how each concept connects to the next. Learn at your own pace, explore
                    freely, and build understanding from the ground up.
